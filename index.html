          React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is an open-source JavaScript
          library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and
          a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used
          as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.
          However, React is only concerned with rendering data to the DOM, and
          so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional
          libraries for state management and routing. Redux and React Router are
          respective examples of such libraries.</b

      <p style="font-family: cursive; font-size: 18px; padding-left: 50px;">
        React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views
        for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update
        and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative
        views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.

      <p style="font-family: cursive; font-size: 18px; padding-left: 50px;">
        Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose
        them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript
        instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and
        keep state out of the DOM.

        We donâ€™t make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so

          React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook,
          who released an early prototype of React called "FaxJS". He was
          influenced by<br />
          XHP, an HTML component library for PHP. It was first deployed on
          Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and later on Instagram in 2012. It was
          open-sourced<br />
          at JSConf US in May 2013. React Native, which enables native Android,
          iOS, and UWP development with React, was announced at Facebook's
          React<br />
          Conf in February 2015 and open-sourced in March 2015. On April 18,
          2017, Facebook announced React Fiber, a new core algorithm of React
          library <br />for building user interfaces. React Fiber was to become
          the foundation of any future improvements and feature development of
          the React library.<br />[needs update] On September 26, 2017, React
          16.0 was released to the public. On February 16, 2019, React 16.8 was
          released to the public. The <br />release introduced React Hooks.</b

        I started of with React through Whitehat Junior course from class no.53
        and I am using a web editer known as Expo for writing React. As far as I
        know in React mostly we deal with 'Components'. I found it intresting
        because it has both html(which is easy to code) and javaScript(which is
        fun to code). Check below to see my journey with React:

          The above code was my first code in React. By seeing the above image
          we can understand that what ever the components we are using we have
          to import it from the other files. Whatever the classes we use we have
          to extend it from 'Component'. And then i have created a personal
          class called as White inside which I have called a Render function and
          inside it i have used return and created Button component which I have
          imported form other files. Then there is a pre-defined class where we
          write all main code. Again I have called render function and used
          return. Inside return I had created a View component which displays my
          code. Inside View I have called White class which we created and also
          created a Text component which displays text whatever i wrote in it.

          The above code was my second code in React. By seeing the above image
          as usual we have to import the Components we need from the other
          files. First I have created a personal class called as RedButton
          inside which I have a displayPop function in which i gave a alert
          which pops out this text "THIS IS A POP OUT" and then I called a
          Render function and inside it i have used return and created Button
          component which I have imported form other files and gave it some
          color and used a property known as "onPress" which shows a pop out and
          inside it I have called the displayPop function. Then In pre-defined
          class I have called render function and used return. Inside return I
          had created a View component which displays my code. Inside View I
          have called RedButton class which we created and also created a Text
          component which displays text whatever i wrote in it.

          The above code was my third code in React. In the 2nd image as usual i
          have imported all the Components which I need in the code. Then I
          created a personal class in which I created a function known as
          "playSound" which we asynced(we use this whenever we use "awaited")
          and then used await (that means we are waiting for the response) for
          Audio component and gave a link of the sound we want to produce when
          we press the button and then we called a render function and a return
          in it and gave "TouchableOpacity" which creates a button and then
          declared a styleSheet which we created from line no.26 to 43. and then
          called onPress propertie and called "playSound" function in it and a
          Text component which also has some styles (from line no.26 to 43 i
          have gave some CSS properties for button and text). Then lastly in
          this file I have exported it.(all this code is written in a seperate
          file created in components folder).<br /><br />
          In the above 1st image as usual we have to import the Components we
          need from the other files and mainly imported the SoundButton file
          form components folder.In the pre-defined class I have called Render
          function and inside it I have used return and created View component.
          Inside View I have called SoundButtton class which we imported from
          components.
